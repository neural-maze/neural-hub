## Description 

This repository contains a crewAI application for generating LinkedIn posts automatically. 
The crew consists of [three agents](agents.py):

1Ô∏è‚É£ LinkedIn Scraper Ninja 

It uses a [Selenium custom tool](tools%2Flinkedin.py) to scrape my LinkedIn profile. I need to scrape my
posts since I want some examples for the last agent to emulate my writing style. This tool needs some env variables,
defined in an `.env` file (you can see an example [here](.env.example)).

2Ô∏è‚É£ Web Researcher

It fetches relevant information about a given topic. In my case, I chose the recent release of Llama3 by Meta AI, but
you can choose whatever you want (you'll need to modify the Tasks and Agents of course ...)

3Ô∏è‚É£ Influencer Agent

This agent has to deal with the information gathered by the two previous agents and write a high quality and engaging 
LinkedIn post emulating my writing style.

## Usage

First of all, install the necessary dependencies.

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

After all the dependencies are installed, run the `main.py`.

> Keep in mind that you need to have all the necessary env variables in your `.env` file for this to work. Also, if you
want to change the topic of your LinkedIn post, you'll need to modify the Agents and Tasks.

```shell
python3 main.py
```
